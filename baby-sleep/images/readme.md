# Example visualizations of infant sleep patterns

 * sleep.pdf: raw data, days on the x-axis, time on the y-axis. Days are separated on the infant's natural time scale from waking up on the first day
   to waking up the day after rather than on a 24 hour time scale.
 * relativeDuration.pdf: proportion of hours spent alseep and awake.
 * relativeDurationDayNight.pdf: proportion of hours spent alseep and awake separated by day and night.
 * requiredActions.pdf: number of ``asleep actions'' (making the baby fall asleep) per day.
 * efficiency.pdf: number of minutes slept per alseep actions, that is, how long the baby slept each time he was tucked in/rocked etc.
