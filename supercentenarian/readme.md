# Evidence of a limit to human lifespan

In a paper that sparked a worldwide media sensation, Dong, Milholland and Vijg (2016) claimed that human lifespan is limited. However,
the methodology what they used is its best shaky, most likely plainly wrong. First, they looked at annual maximum ages at death but forgot
to take sample sizes from which they arise into account. A [reanalysis of the data](sample_size.md) shows that ignoring the number of 
registered supercentenarian deaths is wrong: about 64% of the variation in the maximum ages at death can be explained by the logarithm of
the sample size. 

Furthermore, they claimed that there was a trend break in the increasing supercentenarian ages at death in 1995. Besides that there was a trend
break in the increasing registrations of supercentenarian deaths counts, more [robust estimations](conditional_quantile_regression.md) which look at the median and a trimmed 
maximum of the distribution of supercentenarian deaths shows that such a trend break did not exist: the median age of supercentenarian
deaths has been improving since 1950 while the trimmed maximum (90th percentile) seems to be constant.
